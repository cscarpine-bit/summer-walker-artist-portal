# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Supabase Redirect URL Issue

## ❌ **Current Problem:**
- Email verification redirects to `http://localhost:3000` (wrong!)
- Users can't complete verification
- App shows "welcome back" but doesn't proceed

## ✅ **Solution: Update Supabase Project Settings**

### **Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard**
1. Open: [https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kzxyynbgebhsnfehccdo](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kzxyynbgebhsnfehccdo)
2. Click on **Authentication** in the left sidebar
3. Click on **URL Configuration**

### **Step 2: Update These URLs**
**Site URL:**
```
https://cscarpine-bit.github.io/summer-walker-artist-portal/
```

**Redirect URLs (add these):**
```
https://cscarpine-bit.github.io/summer-walker-artist-portal/email_verification.html
https://cscarpine-bit.github.io/summer-walker-artist-portal/
```

### **Step 3: Save Changes**
Click **Save** at the bottom of the page

## 🔧 **Alternative: Quick Fix in Flutter App**

If you can't update Supabase settings right now, we can work around it by handling the localhost redirect in the app.

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

1. **Update Supabase settings** (Step 1-3 above)
2. **Try signing up** with a new email
3. **Check email verification** - should now redirect to your GitHub Pages URL
4. **Verify the app** shows the main screen after verification

## 📱 **What This Fixes:**

- ✅ **Email verification** will redirect to correct URL
- ✅ **Users can complete** the signup process
- ✅ **App will properly** show main screen after verification
- ✅ **No more localhost** redirects

## 🚀 **After Fix:**

Your authentication flow will work perfectly:
1. User signs up → Gets verification email
2. User clicks email link → Goes to your verification page
3. Verification page → Shows success and redirects to main app
4. User returns to app → Automatically signed in

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST update the Supabase project settings for this to work!**
